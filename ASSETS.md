# Assets

Currently the application has to be created with their assets bundled to the project. In the future asset loading bia HTTP should also be available.

## Important Notice

## Asset Requirements

To run this project with visual assets, you will need to obtain card images and other game assets separately. The project is designed to work with placeholder assets and can be extended with official artwork.

## Available Assets

High-quality card assets inspired by Queen's Blood are available from:

These assets are fan-created recreations based on the original game and are provided separately from this codebase.
